# polar_bears_shop
This is my first full-stack web application.

- I used Java Spring Boot to make the backend of the app. 
- JavaSpring, HTML, and CSS were used for creating the frontend.
- Both the backend and frontend are deployed using Docker.

## In order to test/use it:
- Make sure you have Docker installed
- Clone the repository to any directory on your local machine
- Then fix some settings in the **polar_bears_shop.yml** file
  - **line 10:** change this external port (5001) to any port if it is already occupied on your local machine
  - **line 21:** change this external port (8080) to any port if it is already occupied on your local machine
  - **line 35:** choose any **empty** directory on your machine and place the path to this directory here. It will be used as a place for storing database data
  - **line 37:** change this external port (5433) to any port if it is already occupied on your local machine
